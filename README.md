BOXRIFICE

Target Device: iPhone 11

Requirements: The project must be built in XCode and run on a physical device.
Warning:  iOS simulators in XCode will not support the AR functionality utilized in this game. 

Welcome to Boxrifice: An AR Game. In this game, your goal is to hit as many boxes as possible or create as many collisions as possible with unlimited bullets within 10 seconds. Find out all the ways you can score points to be the best.

When the app is launched, it will take you to the game’s menu page. The menu page displays the highest score and a “start game” button. If the start game button is pressed, it should take a few moments to load the game resources. It would take longer if the app is being launched for the first time. Please wait until the rear camera turns on. 

After the rear camera is turned on, please hover your device slowly over any horizontal surface pointing at the horizontal surface. As soon as the device detects a horizontal surface, it will show a marker on where the surface was detected. Tap anywhere on the screen to place the stack of boxes. As soon as you tap the screen, a countdown for 10 seconds will be started. 

After the boxes are placed, tapping anywhere on the screen will launch bullets. Try to hit as many boxes as possible with the bullets or cause as many collisions as possible among the boxes to score points. After 10 seconds, the game will show the total points and prompt the user to go back to the main menu, from where the user can play the game again.
